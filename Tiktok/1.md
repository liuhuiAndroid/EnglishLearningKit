What's your name? I'm Claudia.

Where you from? Australia.

How long have you been in New York City?

Only 10 days. How long you staying here?

Only 10 days. Why you here?

I'm here to visit. It's been my dream to come for many,

many years, and I'm finally here.

How much money will you spend on your entire trip to New York City?

Including everything? Oh, god,

probably around. Including everything,

probably over ten grand. And how will you spend it?

Well, I've spent it, obviously. Flights,

accommodation, a lot,

um, around food, shopping.

All of it? Yeah.

What's your occupation? What do you do?

I work in tech sales. And how did you get into that?

I just got into it through reaching out to different companies

that I was interested in working for

straight out of high school.

I study on the weekends and so it was a lot of hustle involved.

But I eventually landed a really lower level job

and work my way up into sales.

How much money do you make per year doing that?

Let's do it. Numbers

in AUD. I know.

So in AUD, I'm making around 120,000,

which would probably be around 90 or 100 USD.

So with work. Look,

how many hours do you work?

What does your workday look like?

I'm working around probably nine to 10 hours a day.

So I'm getting into the office around 8

and probably leaving around 6 to seven PM.

So it's a bit longer. Than a normal work day,

but it's nothing unreasonable.

Did you need a college degree to get the job?

No, I haven't finished my degree yet.

How old are you? I'm only just turned, uh.

Sorry, I've only just turned 20.

What's your advice to all the girls out there

that wanna have a similar job experience

and make that much money? Uh, 20,

21, 22.

What's your advice to them?

My advice would be you miss 100% of the shots you don't take.

I've got it tattooed on me here,

you can see. But, um.

Just like you have to take every fucking shot that you can.

Even if you're gonna. Sorry,

pardon my French. But even if you're gonna embarrass yourself,

even when it's not gonna work out.

I spend most of my days cold calling

and I. I cannot let myself be restricted by my nerves,

by my fears of being turned down.

Like, I'm just.

You gotta be ruthless, you gotta be honest.

And you don't let being a girl set you back.

Because often times people will not take you as seriously as you know

when. If you wanna be a man

but miss 100% of the shots. So take everyone.
