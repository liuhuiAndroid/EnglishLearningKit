    A: Oh, look, there’s Caroline and her boyfriend. She’s always going on about him at the office. Oh, great, they saw us. They’re coming this way.
    
    B: Oh, man...
    
    C: Jessica! Arthur! Hi! I’d like you to meet my boyfriend Greg, he’s the V. P. of quality and safety for a top Fortune 500 food company.

I also have to oversee daily operations of our quality control for the entire east coast. That alone means I have 1,500 employees under me. 
    
    B: Wow, yeah... that sounds exciting.
    
    D: And what about you, Arthur? What do you do for a living?

29. English Pod 029 | 投资新兴市场

    ```
    A: Dad, I’d like to borrow some money.
    
    B: Sure, Johnny, how much do you need? five bucks?
    
    A: Come on, Dad, I need thirty thousand. I wanna get into the market. You know, I’m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn, the inevitable recession, people stuffing their money in their mattresses. I look at this as an opportunity.This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg.
    
    B: All I know about that; with all the uncertainty in the markets right now, it would be a very unwise decision to invest. I don’t know if you’re aware son, but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently. There've already been half a million layoffs in the last few months, and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact upon the economy. There’s just too much instability. I just wouldn’t feel comfortable investing in this climate.
    
    A: But look at it this way, every challenge is an opportunity. And anyway, I’m not talking about investing in the domestic market. There are emerging markets that promise great returns. Look at China, for example; they have 1.4 billion people, half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class. Here alone, the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity.
    
    B: Oh, come on, son, you’re looking at this too naively, the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability, and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point.
    
    A: Fine, then! If that’s the way you feel, so be it. But you’re losing out on a great opportunity here. I’m going to go hit up Mum for the cash.
    
    A:爸爸，我想借一些钱。
            B:当然可以，强尼，你需要多少?5美元吗?
            A:拜托，爸爸，我需要三万。我想投资市场。我听腻了所有关于经济衰退的消息，人们把钱塞在床垫里。我认为这是一个机会。对我来说是一个赚钱的好机会。
    
    B:据我所知，由于目前市场的不确定性，投资是非常不明智的决定。我不知道你是否了解，儿子，最近市场上出现了很多动荡。在过去的几个月里，已经有50万人失业，我们也不知道拟议的经济刺激计划将如何影响经济。有太多的不稳定性。在这种环境下投资我觉得不怎么好。
             A:但要这样看，每一个挑战都是一个机会。无论如何，我不考虑投资国内市场。新兴市场有望获得巨大收益。以中国为例:他们有14亿人，5亿人最近进入了中产阶级。单单这，对消费品的总需求就表明了一个创造财富的好机会。
             B:哦，得了吧，儿子，你看得太天真了，中国市场表现出了很大的不稳定性，他们的货币贬值了将近一个百分点。
    
     A:好，那，如果你这样想，你失去了一个很好的机会。我去找妈妈要钱。
